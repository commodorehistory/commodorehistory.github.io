1976 was a historic moment for both the 6502 processor and Commodore's start into developing computers. The Commodore KIM-1 computer is widely regarded as the first true computer (by today's definitions) produced by Commodore. It was a simple computer with 1k of memory and a basic bare PCB designed for engineer's and hobbyists that love to tinker.
