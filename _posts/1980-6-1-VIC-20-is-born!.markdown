Summer of 1980 marks the birth of the Commodore VIC-20, however the story goes back to 1977! At the same time that Commodore was releasing the PET onto the market, MOS Technology had designed a video chip known as the 6560. It was also called Video Interface Chip, or VIC for short. This chip was designed with the idea of selling it to companies who made anything that had a screen and needed to display text on it. So, anything from arcade machines to biotech monitors. The trouble was, they could never find any customers for the chip. By early 1980, Commodore’s CEO Jack Tramiel had been looking for some kind of low-cost color computer that could be ready by CES before the end of 1980. Several projects were going on at Commodore at that time to do just that, including one enthusiastic engineer who had created in his spare time something he dubbed the MicroPet. Now, when Jack Tramiel saw the MicroPet, he decided this would be the computer they would continue to develop and have ready by CES. And so by using the existing VIC video chip design, the Commodore VIC-20 was born. So, obviously it’s name is derived from the VIC-chip at the heart of this machine, but there is some debate as to where the number 20 came from.
