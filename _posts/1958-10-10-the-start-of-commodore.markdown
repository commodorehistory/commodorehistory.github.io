October 10, 1958 marks the day that Jack Tramiel founded Commodore. They began their journey by selling and reconditioning typewriters overseas. Later in during the 60s they purchased a factory in West Germany to produce their own typewriters. They did dip their toes into audio equipment and office furniture but this was never going to be their legacy.

During the late 60's Commodore started to manufacture their own calculators as their popularity boomed during that period. Throughout the end of the 60's and early 70's Commodore had a profitable and wide selection of calculators from the low-cost simple calculators to the higher performance programmable ones. Eventually they purchased MOS Technology Inc and eventually developed the popular 6502 processor.
